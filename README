This is a really basic helper class that takes an associative arrays as a constructor parameter and then parses the files contained in the css directory replacing the the keys with the values. 

Basic use. 

Let's say whe have a style.css file in the "css/" directory which holds the following code

html, body{
	color:{textColor};
	background-color:{backgroundColor};
}

//This preloads and convert all files that are found in the "css/" directory
//you can change this parameter by changing the $cssDir private variable
$css = new Css(array("{textColor}" => "black", "{backgroundColor}" => "white"));
//This recreates the previously loaded and converted file files in the $outCssDir directory 
$css->renderToFile();

//we have a file called style.css in the directory ../css that holds the following code:
html, body{
	color:black;
	background-color:white;
}
//this just echoes a <style> block
$css->render();

//the following element is rendered
<style>
html, body{
	color:black;
	background-color:white;
}
</style>
